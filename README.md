# esp8266_p1meter

Software for the ESP2866 that sends P1 smart meter data to an mqtt broker (with OTA firmware updates)

## Updates

### March 2023:
* Peak power usage, is include as of march 2023. Implemented for and tested on the belgian smartmeters.
  More details of the eMUC 1.7.1 verion can be found here: [maakjemeterslim.be/](https://maakjemeterslim.be/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc01DIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5ea3b7f3ca44446cdb06da065b3e4273b3950c99/e-MUCS_P1_Ed_1_3%20(1).pdf?disposition=attachment)
  * process 15min powerpeaks
  * process maximum monthly powerpeak
  * process average monthly powerpeak /12 monhts
    * send the 12 values as JSON over MQTT.

## Upgrading

When upgrading this sketch from the older version that uses software serial, make sure you re-check the pins and the wiring.
The used pinout has changed since the switch to hardware serial (starting at version `0.0.2`)

# Getting started

This setup requires:
- An esp8266 (nodeMcu and Wemos d1 mini have been tested)
- A 10k ohm resistor
- A 4 pin RJ11 or [6 pin RJ12 cable](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/kabels/adapters/rj12-naar-6-pins-dupont-jumper-adapter) Both cables work great, but a 6 pin cable can also power the esp8266 on most DSMR5+ meters.

Compiling up using Arduino IDE:
- Ensure you have selected the right board
- Using the Tools->Manage Libraries... install `PubSubClient` and `WifiManager`
- In the file `Settings.h` change `OTA_PASSWORD` to a safe secret value
- Flash the software

Compiling up using PlatformIO:
- Ensure the correct board type is selected in project configuration
- In the file `Settings.h` change `OTA_PASSWORD` to a safe secret value
- Upload the software. Keep using the OTA Password the same during OTA updates.


Finishing off:
- You should now see a new wifi network `ESP******` connect to this wifi network, a popup should appear, else manually navigate to `192.168.4.1`
- Configure your wifi and Mqtt settings
- To check if everything is up and running you can listen to the MQTT topic `hass/status`, on startup a single message is sent.

Reset the wifi and other parameters:
- [DoubleResetDetector] (https://github.com/datacute/DoubleResetDetector) library is added.
- when pushing the reset button twice within 10 seconds (or set in the `DRD_TIMEOUT`) the wifi settings will be cleared.

## Connecting to the P1 meter
Connect the esp8266 to an RJ11 cable/connector following the diagram.

| P1 pin   | ESP8266 Pin |
| ----     | ---- |
| 2 - RTS  | 3.3v |
| 3 - GND  | GND  |
| 4 -      |      |
| 5 - RXD (data) | RX (gpio3) |

On most Landys and Gyr models a 10K resistor should be used between the ESP's 3.3v and the p1's DATA (RXD) pin.
Many howto's mention RTS requires 5V (VIN) to activate the P1 port, but for me 3V3 suffices.

### Optional: Powering the esp8266 using your DSMR5+ meter
When using a 6 pin cable you can use the power source provided by the meter.

| P1 pin   | ESP8266 Pin |
| ----     | ---- |
| 1 - 5v out | 5v or Vin |
| 2 - RTS  | 3.3v |
| 3 - GND  | GND  |
| 4 -      |      |
| 5 - RXD (data) | RX (gpio3) |
| 6 - GND  | GND  |

## Data Sent

All metrics are send to their own MQTT topic.
The software sends out to the following MQTT topics:

## Home Assistant Configuration


Use this [example](/assets/p1_sensors.yaml) for home assistant's `sensor.yaml`

The automatons are yours to create.
And always remember that sending alerts in case of a power outtage only make sense when you own a UPS battery :)


Although I've never had issues as a result of using this sketch reading my p1 meter, software can change, bugs can be introduced and incidents happen.
Using this sketch is at your own risk ;)

Powering your meter from your p1 port should be safe as the power outlet is fully isolated from the meter but still: Don't look at me if you blowup your meter ;)

## Contributors

A special mention for the contributions made by other developers that make working on this sketch more fun and helped this project forward by fixing bugs and adding functionalityand to those that took the time to write down the information that helped understanding what the p1 meter was about. If you are one of them and not yet on the list, I'd love to add your name as I think it's important to mention those that enable us to have nice toys.
